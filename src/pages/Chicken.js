                        <p class="left">Early in the morning we went to the market with the intention of getting 3 chicks, but once we saw them and how cute they were, we could not stop at 3 chicks and managed to get 2 more buddies for the flock.</p>
                        <div class="facts">
                            <p class="left">A "Straight run" of chickens is a mixed group of newly hatched chicks that have not been sexed or sorted by gender. This means that the group will include both male and female chicks, with no way to know in advance which ones will grow up to be roosters and which will be hens.</p>
                            <p class="left">Straight run chickens are not separated by gender at the time of hatching because it's difficult to distinguish between males and females, also more cost-effective and efficient for hatcheries to produce and sell unsorted chicks. Hatcheries typically produce large numbers of chicks at one time, and it would be time-consuming and expensive to sort and sex each individual bird.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="left">Before we brought them home we purchased: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Medicated feed</li>
                                <li>XL storage bin</li>
                                <li>Heating lamp</li>
                                <li>Space heater</li>
                                <li>Pine wood bedding</li>
                                <li>Digital thermometer</li>
                                <li>Feeder</li>
                                <li>Waterer</li>

                            So they would be comfortable when they arrived home.

                            <div class="facts">
                                <p class="left">Chicks have a unique digestive system designed to extract nutrients from food efficiently. They have a high metabolic rate and rapid growth rate, which means they need to eat frequently and excrete waste often. Their small size also means their digestive system processes food quickly, resulting in frequent bowel movements. So, chicks poop a lot because it's a natural part of their efficient digestive process and growth cycle.</p>

                                <p class="left">In some cultures, chickens have been used as symbols of love and courtship. For example, in some parts of rural China, young men give hens and roosters to their sweethearts as a sign of their affection, with the belief that the birds will mate and produce offspring, symbolizing the couple's love and the growth of their relationship. Additionally, some people believe that eating chicken on Valentine's Day can bring good luck and strengthen romantic relationships.</p>

                            <div class="facts">
                                <p class="left">The ideal temperature for chicks depends on their age. For the first week of their life, chicks require a temperature of around 95-100째F (35-38째C) in the brooder area. After the first week, the temperature can be lowered by approximately 5째F (3째C) each week until the chicks are fully feathered and can regulate their own body temperature, which usually occurs at around 6-8 weeks of age.</p>

                                    <p class="left">Chickens need a coop for several reasons:
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Shelter: A coop provides shelter and protection from the elements such as rain, snow, wind, and extreme temperatures.</li>
                                            <li>Safety: A coop provides a safe and secure place for chickens to sleep and roost at night, away from predators such as foxes, raccoons, and hawks.</li>
                                            <li>Nesting: A coop provides a safe and comfortable space for hens to lay their eggs, which helps prevent eggs from being damaged or stolen by predators.</li>
                                            <li>Health: A coop helps prevent the spread of diseases and parasites by providing a clean and dry living space for the chickens.</li>
                                            <li>Regulation: In many areas, there are zoning and health regulations that require chickens to be housed in a designated area, such as a coop, for public health and safety reasons.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        Overall, a coop is an essential part of keeping chickens safe, healthy, and happy, and it provides them with a comfortable and secure place to call home.
